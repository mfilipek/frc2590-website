	  five blog posts that have his name (title) tagged
		- extra photos of member?
		- any suggestions for other things to put on the sidebar on individual
		  member pages?
=================
5.) Sorting Options on the Members page
	- By "type" (mentor, alumni, member)
	- by "team" (build, software, finance, marketing)
	- by "usefulness?" (mrs. wolfe wants her own arbitrary sort order)
		- will need extra "usefulness" field for members
		
	- switch out the current page and a "new" members-container with
	  the new sorting functions/php display functions with the current one
	  with a CSS3 "fade in" effect.
	- Navigation for Sorting options on top, also to jump to a particular
	  section of the current sort (e.g. Members, Alumni or Mentors)

		- the google site one is kinda wonky, (look into formatting?)
=================
9.) Obtain SPONSOR list from Mrs. Wolfe with name of Sponsor + amount donated
		- Sponsor template should include fields for amount donated, logo, name as a bare minimum

		  displays sponsor in order of money donated
		- Icons should also scale with amount donated
		- top THREE sponsor's logos should show up in the footer where
		  I put that temp "sponsor" text
			- that code goes in footer.inc
=================
***
10.) Create Wiki page with all of the different templates, what they are used for
		- include list of all "fields"/variables included with each template
